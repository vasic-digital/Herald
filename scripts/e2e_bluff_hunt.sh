# End-to-end bluff-hunt for Herald per Universal §11.4 + the operator's
# 2026-05-20 standing mandate:
#
#   "Make sure that all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-
#    bluff manner — they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really
#    works as expected!"
#
# Strategy: run EVERY user-visible Herald feature end-to-end against
# real services + assert observable behaviour. A bluffing feature that
# "compiles and tests green" but doesn't work for the user will FAIL
# at least one assertion here.
#
# Eighty-eight invariants (E1..E88; E55 + E62 + E63..E70 + E71..E80 SKIP-
# with-reason in the common no-creds / no-T9-evidence case — E81..E88 new
# in GAP-3 §11.4.85 stress + chaos suite (HRD-122..HRD-128): each runs a
# real hermetic Go stress/chaos test AND cites a docs/qa/<run-id>/
# stress_chaos/ evidence anchor (§11.4.2 / §11.4.5); E71..E80 new in
# Wave 6.5 comprehensive ticket-lifecycle (HRD-101); E63..E70 new in Wave
# 6 inbound runtime; E56-E62 Wave 4b TOON content negotiation; E49-E55
# Wave 4a HTTP/3+Brotli+Alt-Svc+TLS; E37-E42 live in Wave 3b; E45 still
# SKIP-with-reason — pending Wave 3c cross-binary wiring; each invariant
# is the "captured-evidence" for one feature class per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69):
#
#   E1.  pherald binary builds (compile-level — necessary, not sufficient).
#   E2.  pherald version --json returns parseable JSON with required fields.
#   E3.  Default test suite green (anti-bluff audit's I2 — re-asserted).
#   E4.  Inheritance gate + paired I6 meta-test green.
#   E5.  CodeGraph anti-bluff validate (7/7 PASS — symbols actually present).
#   E6.  scripts/audit_antibluff.sh 13/13 PASS (submodule anchor cascade).
#   E7.  pherald serve actually starts + binds + accepts HTTP.
#   E8.  /v1/healthz returns 200 with status:ok + version.
#   E9.  /v1/readyz returns 200 with status:ready.
#   E10. /v1/events POST without auth → 401 (Wave 3b live + JWT-gated; was 501-stub through Wave 2).
#   E11. /metrics returns text/plain + herald_build_info gauge.
#   E12. pherald serve graceful-shutdowns on SIGTERM (drain + exit 0).
#
# Optional (run when podman-machine is up + DOCKER_HOST is set):
#   E13. Quickstart compose Postgres boots + migrations apply + RLS
#        isolation proven via the M2 Postgres integration tests.
#   E14. commons_storage RLS tenant-isolation round-trip (HRD-010 Wave 1).
#   E15. commons_infra queue enqueue/dequeue round-trip against live PG.
#   E16. commons_infra redis TTL round-trip against live Redis.
#   E17. Telegram Send delivers + outbound_delivery_evidence persisted
#        (HRD-011 Wave 1 — live Bot API + live PG).
#   E18. Claude Code Dispatch round-trip + claude_code_sessions persisted
#        (HRD-012 Wave 1 — live CLI + live PG).
#
# Wave 2 flavor-binary invariants (added 2026-05-21):
#   E19-E24. New flavor version --json probes (sherald, cherald, bherald,
#            rherald, iherald, scherald — each --json shape valid + flavor field matches).
#   E25-E27. Serving flavors actually bind + healthz returns 200
#            (sherald, cherald, iherald).
#   E28-E30. Flavor-specific routes return expected status. Wave 3a
#            close-out: sherald GET /v1/safety_state + cherald GET
#            /v1/compliance went LIVE → assert 401 (JWT-gated). iherald
#            POST /v1/webhooks/page stays 501 + HRD-024 until that HRD
#            lands. Body-200 evidence for the live routes is in E44+E47.
#   E31. Representative §43 stub exits non-zero with HRD pointer
#        (sherald destructive-guard → HRD-033 in stderr).
#   E32. New serving flavor graceful-shuts on SIGTERM (sherald).
#   E33. pherald e2e regression sentinel — re-runs the pre-Wave-2
#        version probe after every flavor probe so a flavor regression
#        that breaks pherald is caught (rebuild fresh + version --json).
#
# Optional (live channels, run when operator-supplied creds are present):
#   E34. Full vertical slice — operator hand-sent Telegram inbound →
#        Claude Code → Telegram outbound (HRD-011 + HRD-012 Wave 1).
#
# Wave 4a transport substrate (added 2026-05-22):
#   E49. TCP/HTTPS listener bound on the configured port (lsof TCP probe).
#   E50. UDP/HTTP3 listener bound on the same port (lsof UDP / ss probe).
#   E51. HTTP/2 GET healthz → 200 + Alt-Svc 'h3=":<port>"' advertised.
#   E52. HTTP/3 GET healthz → 200 + JSON body via real quic-go client
#        (compiled inline; observes the QUIC handshake completing).
#   E53. Brotli round-trip — Accept-Encoding:br → Content-Encoding:br +
#        body decodes via andybalholm/brotli to identical identity body.
#   E54. TLS 1.3 + ALPN 'h3' negotiated via openssl s_client probe.
#   E55. tcpdump captures ≥ 4 UDP packets on the H3 port during a real
#        HTTP/3 request (SKIP-with-reason if tcpdump absent / no root).
#
# Wave 4a serving binaries now bind HTTPS on TCP (+ HTTP/3 on UDP) by
# default. Existing E7-E48 HTTPS round-trips use `-k` because the dev
# cert is self-signed (~/.herald/dev-{cert,key}.pem auto-generated by
# commons_tls.ResolveCertSource when ProdMode=false). Operators wanting
# plaintext for legacy probes must export HERALD_DISABLE_HTTP3=1.
#
# Wave 4b TOON content negotiation (added 2026-05-22):
#   E56. Accept: application/json → Content-Type: application/json + body[0]='{'.
#   E57. Accept: application/toon → Content-Type: application/toon + body[0]!='{'.
#   E58. TOON response round-trips via real digital.vasic.toon.Unmarshal.
#   E59. TOON body strictly smaller than JSON body for same payload.
#   E60. WIRE-LEVEL anti-bluff — TOON body first byte not '{' and not '['.
#   E61. Accept q-value preference honored (json,toon;q=0.5 → JSON).
#   E62. SKIP-with-reason — encoder-failure fallback unit-tested only.
#
# Wave 6 pherald inbound runtime (added 2026-05-22):
#   E63. pherald listen lifecycle — boots cleanly + SIGTERM-exits 0 against
#        a real Bot API (gated on HERALD_TGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + HERALD_TGRAM_CHAT_ID;
#        otherwise SKIP-with-reason: getMe handshake would hit api.telegram.org).
#   E64. Bot self-filter — captured docs/qa/HRD-NNN-W6-*/transcript.jsonl
#        contains NO tgram.message line whose payload sender matches the
#        bot's own username (anti-echo-loop wire evidence). SKIP-with-reason
#        until T10b commits a real transcript.
#   E65. Attachment sha256 — for any inbound message with attachments, the
#        on-disk file at docs/qa/HRD-NNN-W6-*/attachments/<sha256>.<ext>
#        actually hashes to <sha256>. SKIP-with-reason until T10b commits.
#   E66. Envelope pre-text — captured cc.dispatch journal line carries the
#        verbatim operator wording "We have received new message from our
#        communication channel ". SKIP-with-reason — requires both T10b
#        evidence AND a journal extension that records the rendered envelope
#        (current journal records user_message text, not the pre-text-
#        prefixed envelope; HRD-NNN-W6e tracks the extension).
#   E67. Opus pin in argv — a captured CC argv line includes the literal
#        "--model claude-opus-4-7" pair. SKIP-with-reason — current journal
#        does not record the spawned argv (HRD-NNN-W6e tracks the argv
#        capture extension; T2 unit test catches the model-flag presence
#        at the cmd-construction layer in the meantime).
#   E68. reply_to_message_id wire-bytes — captured tgram.send_reply journal
#        line carries a non-zero reply_to_message_id matching an earlier
#        tgram.message line's message_id. SKIP-with-reason until T10b.
#   E69. Action routing — issue.open — for any cc.reply line with
#        payload.action == "issue.open", there is NO subsequent tgram.send_
#        reply line for the same inbound (issue.open routes to the issue
#        opener, not back to Telegram). SKIP-with-reason until T10b emits
#        an issue.open-action scenario.
#   E70. Live closed-loop (T9 script) — invoke tests/test_wave6_live_loop.sh;
#        PASS on exit 0; SKIP-with-reason when stdout begins with "SKIP:"
#        (script's own creds-absent guard); FAIL otherwise.
#
# Wave 6.5 comprehensive ticket-lifecycle (added 2026-05-23):
#   E71. Classifier emitted at least one "Type":"bug" + one "Type":"help_command"
#        line in docs/qa/HRD-101-lifecycle-<latest>/transcript.jsonl (proves
#        the deterministic §32.6 classifier ran on real operator input).
#   E72. Issues.md mutation — issues.diff has ≥1 added HRD- row (Bug:/Task:
#        scenario actually appended a workable item).
#   E73. Done: migration — fixed.diff has ≥1 added HRD- row (closure
#        scenario actually moved the row Issues.md → Fixed.md).
#   E74. Reopen: migration — issues.diff has a re-added row OR fixed.diff
#        has a deleted row (reopen scenario reversed the migration).
#   E75. Help: fast-path — pherald-listen.log has at least one "inbound
#        dispatched: help_command (fast-path)" line (classifier bypassed CC).
#   E76. Status: fast-path — pherald-listen.log has at least one "inbound
#        dispatched: status_request (fast-path)" line.
#   E77. Attachment download sha256 — every file in
#        docs/qa/HRD-101-lifecycle-<latest>/attachments/ has a base name
#        (sans extension) equal to its sha256 content hash.
#   E78. Outbound attachment fan-out — transcript carries an attachments[]
#        list OR listen-log records a sendPhoto/sendDocument/sendVoice/
#        sendAudio/sendVideo call.
#   E79. Non-operator Done: rejected — transcript or listen-log carries a
#        "not in HERALD_OPERATOR_IDS" or "Done: rejected"/"Reopen: rejected"
#        line (S9 path).
#   E80. Bot self-filter held — pherald-listen.log has zero panic/fatal
#        lines during the full S1..S15 lifecycle run.
#
# GAP-3 §11.4.85 stress + chaos suite (added 2026-05-27; HRD-122..HRD-128):
#   E81. Runner exactly-once-archive + bounded dispatch under N=16 concurrent
#        replay (-race) → TestRunner_Stress_ConcurrentReplay_ExactlyOnce PASS
#        + evidence anchor runner/exactly_once.txt `archival_exactly_once=1`.
#   E82. /v1/events chaos — input-corruption + duplicate-key + auth-storm →
#        tests PASS + evidence anchor events/categorised_errors.txt
#        `all_malformed_rejected_no_5xx=1` (every malformed body 4xx or transport-rejected, never 2xx-accept, never 5xx, never panic).

#        anchor compliance/pg_drop_fail_loud.log `fail_loud_no_fabricated_200=1`.
#   E84. /v1/safety_state chaos — consistent under concurrent mutation
#        (-race) → test PASS + evidence anchor safety_state/
#        concurrent_mutation.log `consistent_under_concurrent_mutation=1`.
#   E85. pherald listen inbound chaos — malformed payloads degrade, never
#        panic → tests PASS + evidence anchors listen/handle_malformed_raw.txt
#        `panic_free=1` + listen/malformed_payloads.txt
#        `all_malformed_degraded_no_panic=1`.
#   E86. claude_code dispatch chaos — process-death/timeout/truncated-reply
#        tagged-error, no hang (-race) → tests PASS + evidence anchors
#        claude_code/subprocess_kill.log `tagged_error_no_hang=1` +
#        timeout_cancel.log `deadline_fired=1`.
#   E87. RunMigrations chaos — disk-full ENOSPC propagates tagged, not
#        swallowed → TestRunMigrations_Chaos_DiskFull_TaggedError PASS +
#        evidence anchor resource/disk_full_tagged_error.txt `tagged_error=1`.
#   E88. §12.6 host-mem headroom — the resource-exhaustion suite adds
#        negligible host pressure → TestResource_HostMemHeadroom_Section126
#        PASS + evidence anchor resource/host_memory_headroom.txt
#        `section_12_6_headroom_proven=1`.
#   (All eight are hermetic — no live creds / no container runtime needed.
#   The container-pause / real-disk-fill / container-OOM live variants are
#   SKIP-with-reason inside the Go tests themselves. Each evidence-anchor

# pg_self_heal <password> — DEV-CONTAINER PASSWORD NORMALIZATION (best-effort).
#
# Why this exists: the dev `herald-postgres` container (host port 24100) may
# have been created with an arbitrary POSTGRES_PASSWORD (e.g. an operator's
# ad-hoc compose-up, a prior session's password, or the quickstart default).
# Different e2e blocks expect different credentials against the SAME shared
# container:
#   - the `pherald serve` HTTPS probes (E7-E12 / E37-E42) hardcode the DSN
#     password "herald_dev" (commons_infra/boot.go default);
#   - the Go integration tests (E14-E17) hardcode HERALD_DB_PASSWORD=
#     "test-postgres-password-DO-NOT-USE-IN-PROD" via t.Setenv (un-overridable
#     from outside the test process).
# A single Postgres role can only carry one password at a time, so each
# PG-dependent block normalizes the container role password to what THAT
# block needs, right before it runs. This is honest: the block still makes a
# real authenticated connection + asserts real observable behaviour — we only
# reconcile the dev credential so the assertion can reach the wire.
#
# The container's LOCAL unix socket uses `trust` auth (no password), so the
# ALTER works via `podman/docker exec` regardless of the current password.
# No-op (returns 0) when the container or its runtime is unavailable — never
# hard-fails; the block's own `nc -z 24100` reachability gate decides PASS/
# SKIP. NOT captured in git as container state — this re-applies on every run
# so the e2e is self-healing across fresh sessions.

# E63-E70: Wave 6 pherald inbound runtime invariants (added 2026-05-22).
#
# Wave 6 added `pherald listen` — long-poll getUpdates + bot self-filter +
# attachment sha256 content addressing + Opus-pinned Claude Code dispatch +
# tgram.SendReply with reply_to_message_id. The end-user-visible payoff is
# the closed loop: a subscriber types in Telegram → CC processes → a reply
# lands in-thread. The §107 watershed is therefore the captured wire/
# subprocess evidence at docs/qa/HRD-NNN-W6-*/transcript.jsonl (T10b).
#
# Numbering: this set occupies E63..E70 (the next free contiguous range
# after Wave 4b's E62). Wave 5 (qaherald) reserves the symbolic E63..E70
# slot in its own plan; whichever wave commits first owns the verbatim
# range — Wave 6 lands here first (see Wave 6 plan "Numbering note").
#
# Posture: at the moment of commit, T10b (the live closed-loop run that
# produces docs/qa/HRD-NNN-W6-*/transcript.jsonl) has NOT yet run. E64..E69
# therefore SKIP-with-reason. The SKIPs convert to PASS automatically when
# T10b lands a real transcript in-repo. E70 invokes the live-loop script,
# which itself SKIPs cleanly when creds are absent.
