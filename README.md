## Status

Herald is **pre-implementation** (2026-05-15). The repository currently contains:

- This README.
- The current specification at [`docs/specs/mvp/specification.V3.md`](docs/specs/mvp/specification.V3.md) — comprehensive (~3900 lines): project-integration contract, inbound processing pipeline, LLM/agent dispatch with Claude Code, tri-stage reply protocol, versioned reports, multi-format outbound attachments, nine refined flavors. V1 and V2 preserved in [`docs/specs/mvp/archive/`](docs/specs/mvp/archive/) for traceability.
- Project-specific Constitution + operator/agent guides under [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/).
- Mirror declarations at [`upstreams/`](upstreams/) — one shell script per host that exports `UPSTREAMABLE_REPOSITORY`.
- The inheritance gate + paired mutation meta-test at [`tests/`](tests/).
- `.gitignore` tuned for Go (`*.test`, `go.work*`, `coverage.*`) and `.DS_Store`.

There is no `go.mod`, no Go source code, and no build tooling yet. Intended language is Go; standard `cmd/` + `internal/` layout will be used when scaffolding starts.

## Mission

Herald sits between systems that **emit events** and humans/services that **want to be told about them**. It guarantees:

- Every event is delivered to every configured channel for its category.
- Duplicate suppression and routing are explicit, not accidental.
- Delivery failures on one channel never block delivery to other channels.

## Deployment model

Herald is designed to be consumed as a **git submodule** of a larger project (the "consuming project"). The consuming project provides:

- The **Helix Constitution** submodule at its own `<consuming-project>/constitution/`.
- Its own CI / build orchestration that drives Herald.
- Any project-wide configuration (credentials, deployment targets, channel registries).

Herald therefore **does not carry its own copy** of the constitution. See [`docs/guides/CONSTITUTION_INHERITANCE.md`](docs/guides/CONSTITUTION_INHERITANCE.md) for the full rationale and the discovery contract that lets Herald locate the constitution at runtime from any nested depth.

## Governance — Helix Constitution inheritance

Herald inherits unconditionally from the [Helix Universal Constitution](https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixConstitution). Inheritance is enforced by a paired gate + mutation meta-test under `tests/` (see below). Herald-specific extensions live in [`docs/guides/HERALD_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/guides/HERALD_CONSTITUTION.md); there are currently no overrides of any universal clause.

Key invariants Herald inherits from the constitution:

- **No bluffing** — every PASS carries positive evidence (§11.4).
- **Mutation-paired gates** — every new gate has a paired mutation proving it catches regressions (§1.1).
- **No guessing language** — `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`, `seems`, `appears` are forbidden when reporting causes (§11.4.6).
- **Credentials never tracked** — `.env` git-ignored, runtime-load only (§11.4.10).
- **Multi-upstream push** — every commit fans out to GitHub + GitLab + GitFlic + GitVerse (§2.1).
- **Hardlinked backup before destructive ops** (§9).

The constitution lives at <https://github.com/HelixDevelopment/HelixConstitution> and is mirrored to GitLab, GitFlic, and GitVerse.

## Quickstart for developers and agents

### 1. Place a copy of the Helix Constitution alongside Herald

If you cloned Herald standalone (not as a submodule of a larger project), put a clone of the constitution **next to** Herald (not inside it — see [§104 of the Herald Constitution](docs/guides/HERALD_CONSTITUTION.md#§104-no-embedded-constitution-extends-universal-§3)):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HelixDevelopment/HelixConstitution.git \
    $(dirname "$PWD")/constitution
```

This is only needed for standalone work. When Herald is consumed as a submodule of a larger project, that project already provides `<parent>/constitution/`.

### 2. Verify the inheritance contract

```bash
bash tests/test_constitution_inheritance.sh        # gate (7 invariants)
bash tests/test_constitution_inheritance_meta.sh   # paired §1.1 mutation proof
```

Both MUST exit 0. The gate prints `PASS  …` / `FAIL  …` per invariant and a summary line. The meta-test prints `✓ META-TEST PASS` when the gate correctly fails on a mutated constitution.

If `I1` fails (constitution not found), follow the message — clone the constitution alongside Herald.

### 3. Read the inherited rules

In this order, read fully before submitting any change:

1. `<discovered-constitution>/CLAUDE.md` + `Constitution.md` — universal Helix rules.
2. `<discovered-constitution>/AGENTS.md` — anti-bluff, no-guessing, paired mutations.
3. This README — Herald overview.
4. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) / [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — Herald-specific guidance.
5. [`docs/guides/HERALD_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/guides/HERALD_CONSTITUTION.md) — Herald's articles §101–§106.
6. [`docs/guides/CONSTITUTION_INHERITANCE.md`](docs/guides/CONSTITUTION_INHERITANCE.md) — the discovery contract and gate semantics.
7. [`docs/specs/mvp/specification.V3.md`](docs/specs/mvp/specification.V3.md) — current spec (active). Historical V1/V2 in [`docs/specs/mvp/archive/`](docs/specs/mvp/archive/).

## Operator setup guides

Every supported messenger and every supported LLM / agent dispatcher has its own step-by-step setup guide under [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/). **Live** ones are detailed end-to-end (obtain credentials → set env vars → verify integration tests → troubleshooting). **Planned** ones are placeholder stubs that reserve the env-var names so your `.env` stays stable as features land.

### Per-flavor operator guides

Each Herald flavor binary ships with a nano-detail operator reference under [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/), documenting every subcommand the built binary surfaces (`<flavor> --help`), the env/credentials each needs, real example invocations, and which subcommands are live vs not-yet-implemented (all anti-bluff — derived from running the actual binary, nothing invented).

| Flavor | Role | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| `pherald` | Project Herald — the richest flavor: `serve`/`listen`/`watch`/`migrate`/`wizard`/`commit-push` + the §43 GitOps commands | [`docs/guides/PHERALD.md`](docs/guides/PHERALD.md) |
| `sherald` | System Herald — `serve` (`/v1/safety_state`) + the host-safety guard commands (`destructive-guard`, `force-push-gate`, `mem-budget-watch`, `backup-snapshot`, `sysctl`) | [`docs/guides/SHERALD.md`](docs/guides/SHERALD.md) |
| `cherald` | Constitution Herald — `serve` (`/v1/compliance`) + the §11.4 compliance-check catalogue (`creds-scan`, `docs-sync`, `composite-gate`, `readme-sync`, …) | [`docs/guides/CHERALD.md`](docs/guides/CHERALD.md) |
| `bherald` | Build Herald — CLI-only CI/test gates: `evidence-capture` (§11.4.2) + `test-tier-verify` (§40.2 8-tier matrix); `gate-retest` not-yet-implemented (HRD-045) | [`docs/guides/BHERALD.md`](docs/guides/BHERALD.md) |
| `rherald` | Release Herald — CLI-only release path: `changelog-generate` (§5), `tag-mirror` (§4 cross-mirror parity), `gate-retest` (§11.4.40 pre-tag retest) | [`docs/guides/RHERALD.md`](docs/guides/RHERALD.md) |
| `iherald` | Incident Herald — `serve`; `POST /v1/webhooks/page` is a LIVE JWT-gated escalation handler (drives the bindings Pipeline → emits the escalation CloudEvent → 202 + Receipt; third-party pager egress is a follow-up subscriber) | [`docs/guides/IHERALD.md`](docs/guides/IHERALD.md) |
| `scherald` | Status-Check Herald — CLI-only `status-digest` (§11.4.45 rollup) | [`docs/guides/SCHERALD.md`](docs/guides/SCHERALD.md) |
| `qaherald` | QA Herald — Herald's autonomous QA bot: `run` (scenario harness → docs/qa evidence), `mtproto` session lifecycle (`login`/`whoami`/`logout`), `lifecycle` (15-scenario driver, SKELETON) | [`docs/guides/QAHERALD.md`](docs/guides/QAHERALD.md) |

### Credentials master guide

[`docs/guides/OPERATOR_CREDENTIALS.md`](docs/guides/OPERATOR_CREDENTIALS.md) is the umbrella reference covering:

- The 12-factor resolution order (CLI flag > shell exports > `.env` > defaults)
- How to set credentials via `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` (shell-export path) AND `.env` (project-local path) — both supported per spec V3 §3.3
- Pre-commit secrets audit checklist (`.env` not tracked; no obvious-format secrets; `.env.example` only has placeholders)
- Quickstart-compose vs native pherald operating modes
- Troubleshooting (SQLSTATE 28P01, "DSN not set", SKIP-with-reason logic per §11.4.3, …)

Per Universal Constitution §11.4.10: **`.env` files MUST NEVER be committed**. The repo's `.gitignore` already covers `.env`. The committed `quickstart/.env.example` is the only credentials-file that lives in git, and it contains only placeholder values.

### Active blockers — operator action required

[`docs/requirements/blockers/missing_env_variables.md`](docs/requirements/blockers/missing_env_variables.md) — the step-by-step MTProto credential setup the operator must complete to unblock Wave 8 Track B (the full-automation rewrite of `TestSubscribe_LiveBotAPI`, `tests/test_wave6_live_loop.sh`, and Wave 6.5 lifecycle scenarios per HelixConstitution §11.4.98 + Herald §108.m). Available in Markdown / HTML / PDF / DOCX. **Required for §11.4.98 compliance — release-gate item.**

[`docs/audits/full-automation-114-98-audit-2026-05-28.md`](docs/audits/full-automation-114-98-audit-2026-05-28.md) — the canonical classification of every Herald test against §11.4.98 (794 tests audited: 758 COMPLIANT-hermetic, 32 COMPLIANT-with-creds-bootstrap, 4 NON-COMPLIANT-manual-dep, 1 STRUCTURALLY-BROKEN). NON-COMPLIANT items have until 2026-06-27 (T+30 days) to be rewritten before graduating to §11.4.90 Obsolete.

## Mirror & push convention

Herald is mirrored to four hosts. The `origin` remote is **fan-out**: one fetch URL + four push URLs. A single `git push origin main` propagates to every mirror in one operation.

| Remote name | URL |
|---|---|
| `github` | `git@github.com:vasic-digital/Herald.git` |
| `gitlab` | `git@gitlab.com:vasic-digital/herald.git` |
| `gitflic` | `git@gitflic.ru:vasic-digital/herald.git` |
| `gitverse` | `git@gitverse.ru:vasic-digital/Herald.git` |
| `origin` | (fetch from `github`; push fans out to all four) |

Each entry under `upstreams/` is a shell script that exports a single `UPSTREAMABLE_REPOSITORY=…` URL and is meant to be **sourced**, not executed for its output. Capitalization matches each host's brand (GitFlic, GitVerse); do not normalize to lowercase or collapse into one file — external mirror-push tooling keys on the per-file split.

If you ever need to rebuild the fan-out configuration, the constitution submodule ships `install_upstreams.sh` that consumes `Upstreams/*.sh` declarations and configures git remotes accordingly; the same pattern can be adapted for Herald.

**Re-verification cadence (per §11.4.99 (C)):** This README does not contain operator-actionable external-service instructions directly — those are in the linked guides, each with its own cadence. README-level re-verification is **on Herald structural changes** (repo-layout changes, new flavors, new mirror hosts, new linked guides) — no time-bound staleness. Linked guides MUST be kept current per their own footers.
